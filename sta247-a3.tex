\begin{enumerate}
\item The length of time for a student to be served at the university bookstore is a random variable having an exponential distribution with a mean of 4 minutes.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item [(a)] Find the probability that a student is served in less than 3 minutes.
        \begin{itemize}
        \item We know the pdf is defined as $f(x) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x}$, and $\mu = \frac{1}{\lambda}$.
        \item So the cdf is $F(x) = \int_0^x f(x) dx = 1 - e^{-\lambda x}$, and $\lambda = \frac{1}{4}$.
        \item So then $P(X < 3)$ is simply $F(3) = 1 - e^{-3/4} \approx 0.5276$
        \end{itemize}
    \item [(b)] Find the probability that a student is served in less than 3 minutes on at least 4 of the next 6 days?
        \begin{itemize}
        \item The serving times are independent, so we're essentially being asked for the chance that an event with a probability of 0.5276 will occur at least four times in six trials. In other words, $X \sim Bin(6, 1 - e^{-3/4})$.
        \item So $P(X >= 4)$ could be written in R as $\mathrm{pbinom}(4, size=6, prob=(1 - exp(-3/4)) \approx 0.8625206$
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
